# TufTuf Calculator!
My first project made with React JS. 
Simple calculator with dark theme. I used basic react-native. Did destucturisation, Result and Row are components, jsx files. Cleaned project from non-used imports and other.
# Functions
Basic operations like plus, minus, devide, maultiply, power.
It works that way: you click on buttons with numbers or operators, so code make string of your problem. 

### Example:"2+2"

When you press button of result, code makes eval of string and changes content of result-div to result.

# Bugs?
I did it simple, so code has bugs.You can devide by 0, i will be infinity. You can get undefined in special situations, but if you use basic operations you will get normal answers.

### ** does power (3**2=9)

## Hope you like it!
